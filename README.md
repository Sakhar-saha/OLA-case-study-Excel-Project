# OLA-case-study-Excel-Project
Project Description

Welcome to the Ola Cabs Data Analysis project, where I explored and analysed data from Ola Cabs operations using Excel. This dataset offers insights into various aspects of ride bookings, including customer demographics, ride details, costs, and ratings. The data consist of 4951 Rows and 16 columns. 

The objective of this Project is to analyse the data by using many story-telling visualization charts which uses many excel tools in the back such as Pivot Tables, V-Lookup, Data Validation, etc and to transform the raw data it into an insightful Dashboard.

It talks about various issues such as- 


•	Understanding Ride Patterns: Analyze the patterns and trends in ride bookings, including peak months, popular ride categories, and preferred travel distances.

•	Customer Behaviour Analysis: Explore customer demographics and behaviours such as gender preferences, reasons for rides, and satisfaction ratings.

•	Cost Analysis: Evaluate the financial aspects of ride operations, including commission earned by drivers, toll taxes, and total trip costs.

Tools and Techniques Used:-

Data Cleaning

•	Data Formatting: Ensuring consistency in date/time formats and handling any discrepancies.

•	Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing data points to maintain accuracy in analysis.

•	Removing Duplicates: Eliminating duplicate entries for data integrity.

Data Analysis

•	Pivot Tables: Utilized to summarize and analyze ride data based on categories such as month, No-of bookings, Reasons for Ride and ride category.

•	Lookups (VLOOKUP): Created a formula by which for every booking id we can find trip cost, commission cost, driver cost, gender, tax, gender, reason, toll paid can be seen.

•	Data Validation: Used data validation to explore the ratings distribution for different trip reasons and also used in above said formula to go through the entire Booking-id list.

•	Conditional Formatting: Applied conditional formatting to highlight trips with costs above and below the average. Created a flag system for trip ratings: green for high ratings, yellow for moderate, and red for low cost for better visualization.

•	Charts and Data Storytelling Visualization : Utilized various Excel charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to visually represent trends and patterns in ride bookings, to study change in trends of bookings performance in different months.

•	Slicer: Used to filter and interactively explore data based on different criteria such as month or ride category, etc.

Interactive Dashboard

Created an interactive Excel dashboard to showcase comprehensive analysis and insights derived from the dataset:

•	Summary Metrics: Overview of total rides, average distance, and average trip cost.

•	KPI-S: Used this to summarize important aspects of my analysis in just a few cells, showcased important metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Bookings, etc. And by using slicer we can change the categories and my KPI-s will also adjust with the changes.

•	Trend Analysis: Used line chart, Bar chart for better visualization of ride booking trends by month, category average rating, Reasons for ride, etc.

•	Customer Insights: Breakdown of Review Ratings patterns by each ride category, and also created a graph to study customer demographics (gender distribution), which summarizes customer satisfaction and their feedback.

•	Cost Analysis: Breakdown of trip costs, compared average distance travelled with average trip cost by each category to showcase how much an average ride cost. Also created many charts to discuss about driver commission, toll taxes, etc.


Conclusion

This project aims to provide actionable insights into Ola Cabs operations through effective data analysis and visualization techniques in Excel. By giving importance in understanding customer preferences, optimizing ride categories, or improving service quality, this analysis offers valuable insights to stakeholders.
